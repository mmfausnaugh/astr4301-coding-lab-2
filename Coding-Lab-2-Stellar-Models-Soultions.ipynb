    "In this coding lab, we will about higher-level data structures that are useful for scientific programming. We will also learn how to make plots and figures using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use these coding tools to visualize real stellar models, and do some calculations with them.\n",

    "**Full Effort:** To receive a check, you need to demonstrate full effort. You should run your code in every cell (`Shift+Enter`). If the code raises an error, you should try to debug it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to debug things for 2 or 3 hours but can't get it to work, make a note of where you stopped with a comment or print function in the cell. Explain in one or two sentences what the error or problem that you are seeing is and what confusion(s) it is causing you.\n",

    "A check-plus is worth extra credit---one check-plus balances a check-minus. So a check-plus gives you 1.5 percentage points on your final grade. If you want to aim for extra-credit, you have until Friday (Feb. 23) at 10am to work on the coding lab. It is worth saying that I will help you with the coding lab if you bring it to office hours or make an appointment."

    "A Package is some set of useful code or software tools that someone has devleoped and made available. In python, there are a lot of freely-available packages. You can find a large list of Packages on the Python Package Index, aka PyPI: https://pypi.org/. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Package is sometimes also called a \"module\" or a \"library.\" Especially in other languages (like C), libraries are a common term.  In some cases, there are technical meanings; for example, a python package is usually made up of one or more modules. But the basic idea for all of these terms (package, module, or library) is that these are extensions to the core language that give you more functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two very important packages for scientific computing in python are `numpy` and `matplotlib`. `numpy` is short for Numeric Python. `matplotlib` is a package that will plot data for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both packages are very large, in terms of the number of tools and functions that are avaialbe. The packages also have a large userbase and developer base, and you can find a lot of documentation and help for using these pacakges. You should know about the websites, in case you need to find help or read the manuals:\n",

    "\n",
    "A great thing about python is that it is very easy to use packages. To access the tools, you use an `import` command, like this:\n"
